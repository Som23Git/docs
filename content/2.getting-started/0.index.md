Postal is fairly easy to install but running your own mail server isn't something for
everyone. If you use Postal, you will be responsible for configuring your DNS as well
as maintaining the platform (including running upgrades). If this doesn't sound like
something you're up for, try a hosted platform.

The process for installing Postal is outlined below. When you're ready to get started
go to the [Pre-Requisites](/getting-started/prerequisites) page.

1. Install Docker and other pre-requisites
2. Add appropriate configuration and DNS entries
3. Start Postal
4. Make your first user
5. Login to the web interface to create your first virtual mail server
