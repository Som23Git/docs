Postal can be configured through its configuration file or environment variables. There are a fair number of areas which can be configured.

You can review all the available configuration options.

* [Full Postal Configuration file](https://github.com/postalserver/postal/blob/main/doc/config/yaml.yml) - this is an example configuration file that contains all the configuration options along with their defaults and a description. This file would usually exist in `/opt/postal/config/postal.yml`.

* [All environment variables](https://github.com/postalserver/postal/blob/main/doc/config/environment-variables.md) - this page lists all the environment variables. All configuration that can be set in the config file can also be set by an environment variable.

Note: If you change any configuration, you should be sure to restart Postal

## Ports and bind addresses

The web & SMTP server listen on ports and addresses. The defaults for these can be set through configuration however, if you're running multiple instances of these on a single host you will need to specify different ports for each one.

You can use the `PORT` and `BIND_ADDRESS` environment variables to provide instance-specific values for these processes.

## Legacy configuration

The current version for the Postal configuration file is `2`. This is shown by the `version: 2` in the configuration file itself.

Postal still supports the version 1 (or legacy) configuration format from Postal v2 and earlier. If you are using this config file, you will receive a warning in the logs when starting Postal. We recommend changing your configuration to follow the new v2 format which is documented above.
